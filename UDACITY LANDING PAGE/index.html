        <h2>Negroni Sbagliato</h2>
        <p>Sbagliato means 'mistaken' or 'broken' Negroni,” says Joe Campanale, owner of Brooklyn restaurants Fausto, LaLou and Bar
        Vinazo. The drink's name comes from its alleged origin story: At Milan's Bar Basso, a guest ordered a Negroni, and the
        bartender was so busy that he accidentally grabbed a bottle of prosecco instead of gin, resulting in a lower-proof,
        sparkling version of the classic. Campanale's take on the drink, meanwhile, “is almost a 'broken' Sbagliato, in a way.”</p>
        <h3>A 'Broken' Beauty</h3>
        <p>In the hands of Joe Campanale, The Negroni Sbagliato receives a fresh interpretation, evoking the spirit of the original
        'broken' cocktail. With a touch of innovation, Campanale's creation amplifies the essence of the Sbagliato, weaving a
        story of transformation and reinvention.</p>
        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <p>
          <li>1oz Forthave Spirits Red Aperitivo</li>
          <li>1oz Aperitivo Cappelletti</li>
          <li>0.5oz Sweet Vermouth</li>
          <li>1oz Sparkling Water</li>
          <li>Prosecco to top</li>
        </p>
        <p>Combine the first three ingredients in a wine glass. Fill glass with ice. Add sparkling water and prosecco. Stir once or twice very gently to integrate, so as not to dissipate the bubbles. Garnish with an orange slice.</p>
